***THIS IS NOT THE REQUESTED APPLICATION***
I built the main app with one single html file including all the HTML, CSS 
and JavaScript code bundled in one file.

The code in that version doesn't need to initialise npm and install threeJS
or other dependencies. Instead, it imports all the required dependencies
from the cloud CDN. But in the recommended directory structure, I saw a
separate "viewer.js" file. Hence I decided to build the project again keeping
the html css and js separate and using npm init and install to install the 
dependencies. 

This app requires two npm dependencies, Three.JS and Vite. Assuming you 
have cloned the repository, head to the evaluation/threeJS directory via 
the terminal and run "npm install" to install the dependencies. After the 
dependencies are installed, run "npx vite" and use the generated link to 
access the application.
